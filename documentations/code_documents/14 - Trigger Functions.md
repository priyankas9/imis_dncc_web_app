#  Trigger Functions

Triggers in PostgreSQL are database functions that automatically respond to certain events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table. In IMIS, for updating count values in a summary table, triggers are set up to automatically update the count whenever a relevant operation occurs on the base table. Use of triggers in PostgreSQL provides a mechanism for automatically updating summary tables, ensuring data integrity, efficiency, real-time updates, and scalability in database operations.

## GridWardpl_whenApplicationCron

Description: Updates the counts of no of emptying in the grids and wards tables when changes occur in the fsm.applications table.

app\\Console\\Commands\\GridsnWardpl_Applicationcron.php

Command: php artisan updatecount:application

handle()method

-   This method is called when the console command is executed. It contains the main logic of the command.
-   The first part of the handle() method consists of two SQL queries (query_grids_no_emptying and query_wardpl_no_emptying) that update the no_emptying count in the grids and wards tables, respectively.
-   These queries use subqueries to count the number of records in the fsm.applications table that intersect with the geometries stored in the building_info.buildings table, and then update the no_emptying column in the grids and wards tables accordingly.
-   The DB::statement() method is used to execute these SQL update queries.
-   After executing each query, it checks if the update was successful and logs a message indicating so in the Laravel log file (laravel.log).

## GridsnWardpl_whenBuildingCron

Description: Updates counts related to building structures in the grids and wards tables when changes occur in the building_info.buildings table.

app\\Console\\Commands\\GridsnWardpl_whenBuildingCron.php

Command: php artisan updatecount:building

handle()method

-   Two SQL queries are constructed to update various counts related to building structures in the grids and wards tables.
-   These queries use subqueries to calculate counts based on the geometry relationships between buildings and grid/ward polygons.
-   Counts are calculated for different types of building structures (no_rcc_framed, no_load_bearing, no_wooden_mud, no_cgi_sheet), as well as population served and household served counts (no_popsrv, no_hhsrv).
-   The counts are updated in the respective grids and wards records.
-   The SQL queries are executed using Laravel's database query builder (DB::statement()).
-   After executing each query, the command logs a message indicating whether the update was successful or not.

## GridsnWardpl_whenContainmentCron

Description: Update the counts of various types of containments (e.g., pit containments, septic tanks) in both the layer_info.grids and layer_info.wards tables based on changes in the fsm.containments table.

app\\Console\\Commands\\GridsnWardpl_whenContainmentCron.php

Command: php artisan updatecount:containment

handle()method

-   Two SQL queries are constructed to update the counts of different types of containments in the layer_info.grids and layer_info.wards tables, respectively. These queries use subqueries to count the number of records in the fsm.containments table that intersect with the geometries stored in the respective grid or ward geometries.
-   The SQL queries are executed using the DB::statement() method.
-   After executing each query, the command logs a message indicating whether the update was successful or not.

## GridWardpl_whenRoadlineCron.php

Description: Updates grids and wardpl count when utility_info.roads has changes

app\\Console\\Commands\\GridWardpl_whenRoadlineCron.php

Command : php artisan updatecount:roadline

handle()method

-   The first query updates the total_rdlen column in the layer_info.grids table. It calculates the total length of roads intersecting with each grid geometry and rounds the result to two decimal places. The length is calculated in kilometers (km).
-   The second query updates the total_rdlen column in the layer_info.wards table. Similar to the first query, it calculates the total length of roads intersecting with each ward geometry and rounds the result to two decimal places.
-   The SQL queries are executed using Laravel's DB::statement() method.
-   After executing each query, the command logs a message indicating whether the update was successful or not.

## MapTool_QryCron.php

Description: Creates function for grid and wardpl and summarychart

app\\Console\\Commands\\MapTool_QryCron.php

Command : php artisan buildfunction:maptool

handle()

The handle function calls the following functions stored in

config\\qry_maptool.php

-   fnc_set_getPointBufferBuildings
-   This function calculates various counts related to building types within a specified distance of a given point.
-   It uses PostgreSQL's PL/pgSQL language to define the function logic.
-   The function takes longitude, latitude, and distance parameters and returns a table of counts for different sanitation system types.
-   It filters buildings based on their sanitation system technology and geographic location.
-   The result includes counts for each sanitation system type and an aggregate count for other types.
-   fnc_getBufferPolygonBuildings
